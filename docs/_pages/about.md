GRAPLE
======

Distributed computing made easy for lake ecology modeling
---------------------------------------------------------

### <a href="#welcome-to-grapler" id="welcome-to-grapler" class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>Welcome to GRAPLEr.

GRAPLEr is an R-based open-source software product of GRAPLE, the [GLEON] Research and [PRAGMA] Lake Expedition.

GRAPLEr brings the power of distributed computing to the fingertips of lake ecology modelers. While it is relatively easy to run one lake model simulation on a personal computer, it is more difficult to execute multiple simulations, which requires additional computing and human resources. To overcome this problem, GRAPLEr, a distributed computing system, integrates and applies overlay virtual network, high-throughput computing, and Web service technologies. GRAPLEr allows submission of hundreds or thousands of General Lake Model (GLM) simulations, runs these lake model simulations efficiently, and retrieves model output.
