*GRAPLE* is an inter-disciplinary collaboration between computer scientists and lake modelers with the *[GLEON](http://gleon.org/){: target="_blank"} Research and [PRAGMA](http://www.pragma-grid.net/){: target="_blank"} Lake Expedition*.

The *GRAPLE* collaboration's main software product is *[GRAPLEr](https://github.com/GRAPLE){: target="_blank"}*, an R-based open-source software that brings the power of distributed computing to the fingertips of lake ecology modelers.
